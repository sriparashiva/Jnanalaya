<h4>What is Hindu Library Classification System?</h4>
<p>Hindu knowledge system is one of world&rsquo;s largest knowledge collection. It is largest among all religious text. In order to locate books and manuscripts for research or reference purposes, it need a classification system. A Hindu library classification is a system by which all knowledge of Hinduism are arranged according to specific method given by His Divine Holiness Sri Paramahamsa Nithyananda. Internationally, various types of classification systems are used, but all of them fail to provide sufficient place and lacks ability to properly classify Hindu knowledge system. With the aim of becoming world&rsquo;s largest library housing around 20 million books and manuscripts, we designed and developed a unique classification system. This new system, especially developed to classify Indological knowledge system caters as unique identifier for each and its physical location in library. All knowledge system is broadly divided in six major categories i.e. Sruti, Smriti, Itihasa, Purana, Agama and Darshana. Each of these categories can be further expanded to various discipline following our ancient tradition. Below is a classification of the 6 major categories of the Hindu Knowledge System.
